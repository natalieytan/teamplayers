# Concept
## Problem Statement:
Team sports bring a valuable contribution to the social fabric of society, as they, physical activity and active recreation opportunities more accessible to communities. Its benefits are wide-ranging, including physical health, mental health, personal wellbeing, and social cohesion.  

A national survey (AusPlay, July 2016-2017) showed that 58% of adults and 69% of children participated in sport-related activities and regular community-based sport participation, and in Australia generates an estimated AUD$18.7B value p.a. in social capital.

Despite the increasing connectivity, which technology has brought, many sport teams continue to face an ongoing challenge of trying to cobble a team every week.

It is common for clubs needing players to fill their games to send desperate emails, texts and facebook messages from clubs. Meanwhile, players who are looking for games, or interested in joining the club, are often not the recipients of these messages, which have limited reach.

## Solution
The underlying problem is that while clubs are looking for players to fill their games, and players are looking for games, neither have a convenient means of connecting.

The aim of “Teamplayers” is to provide a digital platform, which provides an efficient way to connect the two groups. In, doing so, it also hopes to support the clubs in fostering a community.
